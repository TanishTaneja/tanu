                    <b>During the shooting of his blockbuster movie 'Hum Saath Saath Hain', Bollywood actor Salman Khan allegedly killed two blackbucks in Bhagoda ki Dhani located in Kankani village near Jodhpur. He was charged under section 9/51 of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

                        In what came to be known as the 1998 Blackbuck Case, his co-actors Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu were also charged under Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act and under Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. However, they were all acquitted after being given the benefit of doubt. Two other people, namely Dinesh Gawr and Dushyant Singh, were also accused of being with the actors when the poaching allegedly took place.Khan made his acting debut with the 1988 film Biwi Ho To Aisi, which saw him play a supporting role. He went on to play the leading role in Sooraj R. Barjatya's romantic family drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), which become one of the highest-grossing Indian films at the time.[43][44] It earned him his first nomination for the Best Actor at Filmfare along with a nomination for Best Male Debut at the same ceremony; the latter was awarded to Barjatya.[45] Maine Pyar Kiya was dubbed in English as When Love Calls, in Spanish as Te Amo, and in Telugu as Prema Paavuraalu.[46]

                        1990 saw one film release starring Khan; Baaghi: A Rebel for Love, a box office success,[47] followed by three moderately successful films in 1991, Patthar Ke Phool, Sanam Bewafa, and Kurbaan. The same year, Khan went on to co-star with Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit for the romantic drama Saajan.â€Š[48]</b>
